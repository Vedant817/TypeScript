let greeting: string = "Good Morning" //? Now all the methods suggestion for greeting will be related to the string.
console.log(greeting);

//?Number
let userId: number = 6577 //* No separate data type for the int or float

//! Good Practice: TypeScript is smart enough to get the type of the value being stored.
let id = 31
id.toFixed()

//? Boolean
let isLoggedIn: boolean = false

//! If a variable is assigned any it means that we want Type Checking to be off for that variable.
